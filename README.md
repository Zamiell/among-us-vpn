# Zamiel's Among Us Private Server

## Introduction

- Normally, you click on the "Online" button from the main menu in order to play. However, we our group **does not** use the "Online" feature because the online servers are incredibly buggy and overloaded.
- Instead, we use a VPN (virtual private network) to connect to the same network. Then, we click on "Local" from the main menu. This completely bypasses the server instability!
